This repository contains the code for my project done as part of the course CS 154 - Abstractions and Programming Paradigms Lab under prof. Amitabha Sanyal in the Spring 2018-19 Semester at IIT Bombay. The project consists of three games made using racket - ping pong(PvP and CvP), minesweeper and sudoku.
